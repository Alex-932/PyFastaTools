# PyFastaTools

This a little class I made to get some information on a .fasta or a .fastq file.

It can give you some biological statistics like the proportion of G and C in each sequence.
It also allow you to do some quality check filtering on your sequences.
One tool also allows you to translate your sequences and search for ORF in them.
Finally, it comes with a pattern searching.

The class build an internal dataframe with usefull informations that can be retrieved and easily analyzed.

The code is fully commented and comes with some samples to see how it works :)

It uses 2 packages : NumPy and Pandas.
